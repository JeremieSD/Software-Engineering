# Memory saving mode

The app's dashboard is very machine-intensive, as it must constantly request and process data from several points on the Wikidata API. (It must also store this data in memory to display the graphs, with no limit imposed by default.) We provide a simple `Memory saving mode` checkbox on top of the page to apply various restrictions on the app.

By design, this mode omits and truncates some of the data generated by Wikidata, and is not suited for rigorous academic analysis. However, it suits users with weaker machines who wish to use the app for a simple view of current Wikidata activity.

## How it works

In `Backend/APIWrapper.js`, an object `MEMORY_MODE` is defined as follows:
```js
let MEMORY_MODE = {
  mode: false,
};
export { MEMORY_MODE };
```
This object can be imported into any page or component using
```js
import { MEMORY_MODE } from '../Backend/APIWrapper';
```
The checkbox in `Pages/TestPage.jsx` toggles `MEMORY_MODE.mode` between `true` and `false`.

## What it does

### `Backend/APIWrapper.js`

Memory saving mode applies restrictions on the API level, limiting the amount of requests made to Wikidata when getting new edits or users.

* `getMostEditsUsers()`: Requests limit changed from `max` to `100`.
* `getMostActiveUsers()`: Requests limit changed from `max` to `100`.
* `getRecentEditsWithSize()`: Requests limit changed from `500` to `100`.
* `getRecentEditsWithFlags()`: Requests limit changed from `50` to `10`.
* `queryRecentChanges()`: Requests limit changed from `max` to `100`.
